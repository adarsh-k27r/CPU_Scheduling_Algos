#CPU Scheduling Algorithm

The Simulation Website of CPU Scheduling Algorithm is an interactive platform designed to simulate various CPU scheduling algorithms, including First Come First Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Round Robin (RR), Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF), Priority, and other popular algorithms.

The website provides a user-friendly interface where users can input their own data, including the number of processes, arrival time, burst time, priority, and time quantum. The website then visualizes the scheduling process and displays the results in real-time, providing a clear understanding of how the algorithm works and how it affects system performance.

This simulation website is an excellent tool for students, educators, and professionals who are interested in learning about CPU scheduling algorithms and their practical applications. It provides a hands-on learning experience that allows users to experiment with different scheduling algorithms and understand their impact on system performance.

# File system:

We have two major sections- 
1. Frontend  (using HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP)
2. Backend (using Vanilla Javascript)

-- backend folder: It contains main backend code for the project like all major functions of scheduling algos and other supporting functions for each of them. It also contains Gantt Chart code.

-- eduford_img and images folder contains required images for the project.

-- about.html: This file entails team detail.
-- docs.html: This entails proper documentation of scheduling algorithm and how it works.
-- index.html: This is main Homepage file.
-- ganttcharts.html: This is Gantt Chart frontend code.
-- cpu-scheduler.js: This contains modular codes or say functions for each scheduling algo and other supporting functions like sorting arrival time etc.
-- MathJaxSetup.js: This is MathJax config file which enables MathJax rendering and previews.

MathJax is a cross-browser JavaScript library that displays mathematical notation in web browsers, using MathML, LaTeX and ASCIIMathML markup.

-- new.js: This contains all class related to Input and Output Property e.g calculating Turn Around Time and Waiting Time etc.

-- .css : These are CSS files.

-- bootstrap files are also there in required directories.
